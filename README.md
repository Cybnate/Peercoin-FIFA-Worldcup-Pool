This project supports the Peercoin FIFA Worldcup 2014 Pool, check out peercointalk.org.

Good Day, Peercoin Soccer fans (Football to some) 

The time has come again where we join the world to experience the momentous event of the FIFA World Cup 2014.
The world is watching and we too at Peercoin will be watching ;-)
In order to join the excitement here at Peercoin and by popular demand for a pool to be setup, I will be setting a Peercoin FIFA World Cup Championship Pool where each person is able to pick a team or multiple teams to win the FIFA World Cup and whoever picks the winning team will win the FIFA Pot of PPC. Remember anything can happen in the FIFA World Cup!
Rules to play:

	Check out the list of teams and the placed bets (will try daily updates) on the Google document here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B91ywRLpFMRFNk9fbndQaXRpZ3c/edit?usp=sharing Post in the forum which team or teams you want to place a bet on (max 5) and take note of the forum post number before transferring your Peercoins (see below).

	Donate 2 PPC for each bet to the FIFA World CUP Pool on peer4commit here: <http://peer4commit.com/projects/93

	Important: To be able to identify that you paid I need an identifier. Please add your forum post number behind the dot of the number of PPC you are due. E.g. if you posted your bet(s) on forum post number 5 and you placed 1 bet, please transfer 2.000005 PPC. That way we can check in block chain if everyone paid in time and the correct amount for the number of bets placed.

	Put 2 PPC per square you pick to the FIFA Pot of PPC or Deposit $2 per square you pick to a newly created bank account for easy transfer (Don’t worry I will keep tabs of who pays with the statements I can print out – Details of the bank account is below)

	Sit back and watch the FIFA World Cup  

	Only entries paid before Saturday 14 June 12.00 GMT will be accepted. So make sure you don’t miss out! 

How to win:
	If you pick a team that no one picks and that team wins the FIFA World Cup, you win the FIFA Pot of PPC
	If you pick a team that other people have picked and that team wins the FIFA World Cup, you share the FIFA Pot of PPC with the other people. (eg. 4 people chose the team then the pot is divided by 4)
	If no one picks the team that wins the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Pot of PPC will be contributed to the Peerunity wallet development fund.
	Don’t send payments that are inadequate, not identifiable or too late. They won’t join the pool and will be donated to the Peerunity wallet development fund at the end of the World Cup.
	Ensure you post a PPC address in the thread when you win in order to receive the FIFA Pot of PPC or your share of it.
Alright people, let the Peercoin FIFA World Cup Championship Pool begin!
 
Remember this is all for fun, if you are not interested then please don’t play this pool.
